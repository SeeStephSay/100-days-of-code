### Day 2: June 4, 2019 - Tuesday


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Skillcrush 102 - Introduction to JavaScript & FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. 

**Thoughts**: Skillcrush was focusing on Pseudocode today. I was already writing in pseudocode when we were supposed to just be writing logical statements in plain text, but now that we are supposed to officially be writing in pseudocode, it's like I'm way overthinking it, and I keep messing up. Then again, I'm running on just a few hours of sleep, and I'm struggling just to stay awake, let alone learn new things, haha.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
